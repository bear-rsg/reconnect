The RE:Connect project aims to deepen RE teachersâ€™ understanding and confidence for exploring the environmental crisis through the lens of religions and worldviews in RE. We firmly believe that topics like climate change and sustainability aren't just a matter for science classes, and that it is also crucial to design learning on these topics as a part of our culture, values and worldviews in ways that humanities subjects, and RE particularly are ideally placed to support. The project connects fellows up with cutting-edge research in religion and ecology, theological ethics and sustainability education, but our work isn't exclusively content focussed. We use an innovative teacher fellowship model that empowers teachers to draw on existing pedagogical expertise and contexts develop new and innovative curriculum projects which is tailored to real-life classroom situations.

You can access these curriculum projects for use in your own teaching, or as inspiration for curriculum development on this website under the [projects gallery](https://bear-rsg.github.io/reconnect/projects_gallery.html). Projects have been pilot-tested in other classroom contexts and we hope that you'll add your own experience and questions to our project.

We also provide a range of resources that project participants have found inspiring and helpful under [resources](https://bear-rsg.github.io/reconnect/resources.html).

The programme is not just about getting ideas, but also enhancing teaching practice and expanding teacher's professional networks. Fellowship programme participants are supported to become ambassadors for further work in this field. You can meet our project team and fellowship alumni on our [team page](https://bear-rsg.github.io/reconnect/team.html).
