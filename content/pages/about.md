RE:Connect is a new project designed to help deepen teachers’ understanding and confidence for exploring the environmental crisis through the lens of religions and worldviews in RE.

<div class="focus_highlight"><p>A key focus for this project has been an innovative Teacher Fellowship programme, which ran in autumn 2021/spring 2022, in which four primary and four secondary teachers from the WM region worked together with experts in the field to deepen their subject knowledge and work together to create new resources for RE.</p></div><br>

### Other Focus Areas

The project also covers several important areas:

*  **A survey of teachers of RE**, hearing their views on what part environmental concerns currently play in RE/Religions and Worldviews, and how this might be expanded in future.<br><br>
*  A dissemination phase in which new resources are pilot-tested and fellowship programme participants are supported to become ambassadors for further work in this field.

### The People

The initiative is run by Dr Jeremy Kidwell, Senior Lecturer in Theological Ethics at the University of Birmingham and Dr Ian Jones of St Peter’s Saltley Trust, supported by a steering group of experienced primary and secondary specialists, environmental scientists and practitioners.
