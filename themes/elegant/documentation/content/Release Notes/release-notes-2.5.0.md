We plan to add support for other comment providers besides Disqus. This release is first step towards it.

In this release we also resolved an issue in our automated release process. From now onwards, all new releases will happen automatically with minimum human intervention.

### Features

- **comments:** replace disqus_identifier with comment_id ([3aa4e24](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/commit/3aa4e24)) <!-- yaspeller ignore -->
